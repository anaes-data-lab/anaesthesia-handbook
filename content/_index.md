This website is a resource for anaesthetists caring for paediatric patients who require care across the Parkville precinct.

It is important to note that these documents are a guide only - they are not the policy of any hospital or department, and are intended to assist with some of the logistical challenges involved with caring for patients outside their home hospital.

For policies and procedures, please refer to the [RCH Anaesthesia Intranet](https://rch0365it.sharepoint.com/sites/AnaesthesiaAndPainManagement) website.
