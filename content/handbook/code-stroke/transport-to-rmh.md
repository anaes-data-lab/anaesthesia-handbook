PIPER will coordinate the code stroke response, and will organise transport to RMH: 

- If a PIPER ambulance is not available, an Ambulance Victoria ambulance may be requested. These have one fewer seat â€“ the anaesthesia technician may be required to travel by taxi to RMH ED; PIPER bears responsibility for organising this additional transport 

For VAD patients, a perfusionist or VAD nurse will travel with the team in the ambulance 

- This may require that the anaesthetist + anaesthesia assistant travel separately by taxi to RMH ED, or that the anaesthetist takes the place of the PIPER doctor 

> [!WARNING]
> If the anaesthesia assistant travels separately, the PIPER nurse must remain with the anaesthetist until the assistant rejoins the team 

> [!NOTE]
> For Epic to work correctly at RMH, the patient must be placed on 'day leave' on iPM by administrative staff at RCH.
