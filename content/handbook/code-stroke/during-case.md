## Using Epic

There are two pre-requisites to ensuring that anaesthesia documentation can proceed on RCH patients at RMH:
1. That the case booking (created by the RMH interventionalist) has the 'RCH anaesthetist required' checkbox ticked
2. That the RCH administrative staff have placed the patient on day leave
