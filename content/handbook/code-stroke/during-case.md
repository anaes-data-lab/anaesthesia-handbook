### Requirements for Epic off-site functioning
There are two pre-requisites to ensuring that anaesthesia documentation can proceed on RCH patients at RMH:
1. That the case booking (created by the RMH interventionalist) has the 'RCH anaesthetist required' checkbox ticked
2. That the RCH administrative staff have placed the patient on day leave

## Blood products and pathology ordering

> [!WARNING]
> Group and Screen specimens processed at RCH cannot be used at other Parkville sites, and must be re-collected

### Transporting blood from RCH
A Code Stroke is a time-sensitive case; it is recommended that blood products **not** be ordered and brought from RCH as a 'just-in-case' measure. Instead, the Royal Melbourne blood bank should be used where possible.

### Changing Epic context for ordering

> [!NOTE]
> Some RCH anaesthetists may not have access to the Royal Melbourne anaesthesia context. In this case, a clinician from RMH must enter the orders from their login
> 
> Assistance in this situation can be sought from the RMH in-charge anaesthetist: [0400-123-456](tel:0400123456)

Pathology and blood bank orders must be made in the RMH context so that they will arrive at the correct pathology lab. This can be done as follows:

    {{< card title="Change context menu" subtitle="Clicking the 'Epic' icon reveals the change context button" image="images/epic/change-context.png" >}}
    {{< card title="Select 'RMH Anaesthesia'" subtitle="The RMH Anaesthesia profile ensures that orders are sent to the correct lab." image="images/epic/rmh-context.png" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

> [!NOTE]
> After ordering what you require, it is advisable to change back to the RCH context so that other aspects of your user interface carry the familiar RCH customisations.
