If the neurology and RMH neuroradiology team decide to proceed with ECR: 

> [!WARNING]
> The RCH anaesthetist-in-charge is to liaise with the RMH anaesthetist-in-charge to inform them of the case, and request that an anaesthetic machine and drug trolley is prepared in the angiography suite. 

An RCH anaesthetist and anaesthesia assistant will be required to travel with the patient and provide care at RMH (estimated 3-4 hours total).  

- Note that code stroke cases require consultant-level care 

Meanwhile, the patient should be intubated for transfer +/- arterial line inserted for VAD patients. The patient must be intubated for transport. 

- Intubation may be performed by the most suitable resource at the discretion of the treating team; in some situations this may be performed by the ED or PICU teams.
